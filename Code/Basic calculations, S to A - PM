# Input values (directly in the code)
distance = .100  # Distance in meters (change this value)
time = 1       # Time in seconds (change this value)

# Calculations
speed = distance / time  # Speed = Distance / Time
acceleration = distance / (time ** 2)  # Acceleration = Distance / Time^2

# Output results
print(f"The speed is: {speed:.2f} m/s")
print(f"The acceleration is: {acceleration:.2f} m/s^2")
